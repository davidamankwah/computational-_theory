    "Countdown is a British game show that involves word and mathematical tasks [<b>[1]</b>](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Countdown_%28game_show%29). The numbers round is the show's most popular segment, in which contestants use a set of six numbers and four basic arithmetic operations, such as addition, multiplication, and subtraction [<b>[2]</b>](https://www.channel4.com/programmes/countdown).

For exapmple, there are 33,665,406 possible expression over the souce numbers [1;3;7;10;25;50], but only 4,672,540 of these expressions are valid, which is just under 14%  [<b>[8]</b>](https://www.cambridge.org/core/services/aop-cambridge-core/content/view/FCF81E290B194D1ACBF699842D4D4CA5/S0956796801004300a.pdf/the-countdown-problem.pdf).\n",

    "Functional programming is a programming paradigm that focuses on using pure functions. Functional programming is based on the concept of composing programs from small, reusable, and predictable pieces of code [<b>[6]</b>](https://github.com/readme/guides/functional-programming-basics).\n",
    "\n",
    "These are functions that can produce the same result for the same input while making no changes to the external state or causing side effects [<b>[7]</b>](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming). Pure functions are easy to test, debug, and reason about [<b>[7]</b>](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming). Pure functions facilitate the testing of solution accuracy. Functional programming revolves around functions, ensuring a clear separation between data and behavior [<b>[6]</b>](https://github.com/readme/guides/functional-programming-basics).\n",
    "\n",
    "The countdown number game lends itself well to a recursive approach. Recursion involves repeating an operation until it reaches a base case, necessitating the maintenance of a stack that consumes space linearly based on the depth of recursion [<b>[7]</b>](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming). In the countdown game, a combination of numbers can be generated recursively and operations can be applied until the target number is achieved.\n",
    "\n",
    "High-order functions are those that acceept other functions as arguements or return them as results [<b>[7]</b>](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming). High-order functions support partial application, which means that a function is applied to its arguements one at a time, with each application returning a new function that accepts the next arguements [<b>[7]</b>](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming). Highe-order allows for the abstraction of common patterns and operations by filetering valid combinations of numbers or applying arthimetic operations. This abstraction promotes code reuse and modularity, ensuring the implementation's flexibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "Functional programming ensures versatility, ease of writing and debugging, and well-structured software. Code debugging is made simple by modularization and the absence of side effects [<b>[6]</b>](https://github.com/readme/guides/functional-programming-basics).\n",
    "\n",
    "We can use functional programming to find a solution on Countdown numbers game. Python lanaguage supports functional programming to some extent. The principles of high-order function, recursion, and pure functions serve as a foundation for implementing the solution to the Countdown Numbers game. Using these concepts, we can write concise, readable, and correct code that generates solutions within the constraints of the gmae."
