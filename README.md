# Computational Theory

<i>By David Amankwah</i> (G00394825)

In Computational Theory from Software Development Year 4, I discuss the Countdown numbers game. I created a Juypter notebook to investigate and demonstrate the Countdown numbers game's challenges and functionality. The work I did researching the topic would be documented in the notebook.

## Countdown Numbers Game
The countdown number game is a popular puzzle game that originated in the United Kingdom. Players are given a target number and a choice of size numbers. The goal of the game is to use basic arithmetic operations on the six numbers to get to the desired numbers. The rules, strategies, and solution will be detailed in the 'countdown.ipynb' notebook.

## Countdown Assessment Notebook
In the 'countdown.ipynb' notebook, I complete an assessment task centered on the Countdown number game. The numbers round of the TV program Countdown will be analyzed and solved. There is a Python function called 'solve_numbers' that can generate solutions for given sets of numbers and target values.

## Getting Started
Before proceeding, install the necessary prerequisites on your system.

1. Anaconda (https://www.anaconda.com/download)
2. Jupyter Notebook (https://jupyter.org/)
3. Python (https://www.python.org/downloads/)
4. Visual Studio Code (https://code.visualstudio.com/)

## How to Install
<h2>Visual Studio Code<h2>

+ Visit the official Visual Studio Code website and click on the "Download" button. Select your operating system.
+ After downloading the installer, find the downloaded file and double-click on it to start the installation process.
+ Once the installation is complete, you can launch Visual Studio Code by searching for it in your applications.
+ Check to see if the installation was done correctly. Open your terminal and enter the following command.
```bash
code --version
```

## Clone the Repository
Open a terminal window, and navigate to the directory where you want to clone the repository.

Here is the following command:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/davidamankwah/computational_theory
cd computational_theory
```
